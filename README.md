#WP Android Permissions [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/firezenk/maven/wpandroidpermissions/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/firezenk/maven/wpandroidpermissions/_latestVersion)

Android Marshmallow permissions made easy

Works flawlessly on:

	android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity extended classes
	android.support.v4.app.Fragment extended classes

###GRADLE:

 	repositories {
	    	...
	    	maven { url 'https://github.com/FireZenk/maven-repo/raw/master/'}
	}
	dependencies {
		...
	        compile 'org.webpartners:wpandroidpermissions:1.5.1'
	}

###USAGE:


1. Add annotations with the desired permissions:

	````
	@ActivityWithRuntimePermissions // at class level for Activities
	
	@FragmentWithRuntimePermissions // at class level for Fragments
	
	@HostFragmentWithPermissions // if an Activity hosts Fragment that requires permissions
	
	@NeedPermissions(Manifest.permission.YOUR_PERMISSION) // at function level
	````
	
2. Add to the invocation of your Activity/Fragments the suffix: _Generated, like:

	````
	startActivity(new Intent(MainActivity.this, ActivityWithPermission_Generated.class));
	````


3. Implement the callback interface on your classes for better permission feedback:

	````
	MyActivity implements PermissionRequestResponse
	````

###MORE INFO:

	Go to sample module
	
###TROUBLESHOOTING:

	By the time, the library is limited to the use of one single permission by activity or fragment
